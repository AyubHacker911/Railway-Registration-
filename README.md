Java based railway reservation project on netbeans.

INTRODUCTION
A plan for a rail system in India was first put forward in 1832, but no further steps were taken for
more than a decade. In 1844, the Governor-General of India Lord Hardinge allowed private
entrepreneurs to set up a rail system in India. Two new railway companies were created and the
East India Company was asked to assist them. Interest from a lot of investors in the UK led to the
rapid creation of a rail system over the next few years.
Railways were first introduced to India in 1853. By 1947, the year of India's independence, there
were forty-two rail systems. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, becoming one of
the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a
multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach
production facilities.
The first train in India became operational on 1851-12-22, and was used for the hauling of
construction material in Roorkee. A few years later, on 1853-04-16, the first passenger train
between Bori Bunder, Bombay and Thana covering a distance of 34 km (21 miles) was
inaugurated, formally heralding the birth of railways in India.
 INTRODUCTION TO THE
RESERVATION
 SYSTEM
The Indian Railways (IR) carries about 5.5 lakh passengers in reserved accommodation every
day. The computerised Passenger Reservation System (PRS) facilitates booking and cancelling
of tickets from any of the 4000 terminals (i.e PRS booking windows) all over the country. These
tickets can be booked or cancelled for journeys commencing in any part of India and ending in
any other part, with travel times as long as 72 hours and distances up to several thousand
kilometers.
The pilot project of PRS was launched on 15 November 1985, over Northern Railway with the
installation of the Integrated Multiple Train Passenger Reservation System (IMPRESS), an
online transaction processing system developed by the Indian Railways in association with
Computer Maintenance Corporation (CMC) Ltd., at New Delhi. The objective was to provide
reserved accommodation on any train from any counter, preparation of train charts and
accounting of the money collected. This application was subsequently implemented in 1987, at
Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Secunderabad. With the addition of new locations and many
redefinitions, the IMPRESS system fell short of growing expectations of the travelling public

RAILWAY RESERVATION METHODS :
COUNTER BOOKING:
This is oldest method of booking the ticket. The reservation counters are there at
railway departments from where people can get the tickets to their respective destinations.
Nowadays there are various ticket counters, apart from railway station counters where tickets are
available.
 
PROPOSED RESERVATION SYSTEM
 ADVANTAGE
• The proposed system is comparatively faster than the existing system.
• As the proposed system is comparatively faster than the existing system, there will be
 very less rush and shorter queues at the reservation counters or centers.
• In the proposed system, we are also making database for all the trains running across the
 country.

• As required, we can edit the database of the trains and also add the new trains which will
 be proposed in future budgets
 MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT :
1. The acquisition and maintenance of a relational database with the help of hardware,
 communication network and software including system design.
2. To assess the if system chosen in the project operates in an adequately controlled
 environment.
3. Whether the application’s control are adequate and if the system is in compliance with
 rules.
4. To show an effective mechanism to ensure most economic usage of available resources.

SCOPE OF OUR PROJECT WORK

1. The scope of project included evaluation of the application and was primarily concerned with
the transactions related to booking of tickets from the terminals operated by the railway
personnel. 
2. Application controls, simulation and online enquiries were used to evaluate data validation and
program logic. The selected data, as made available, for substantive checking of the
completeness, integrity and consistency of data using computer assisted applications such as VB,
MS Access and Structured Query Language (SQL).
REASONS FOR SELECTING THIS SYSTEM IN
 OUR PROJECT
• Indian Railways is huge. There are umpteen number of database in its system. The use of
 MS Access and Visual Basic enables the person at the booking counter a customized and
 easy retrieval of information.

Modules: 
Frontend : Customer Information is taken through a GUI based User Interface as given below


BackEnd : Customer personal data is stored as a txt file in the root directory of the project.
